## 💭 Reflection  

- my testing approach? 
     Started by checking if the button works with an empty field , 
tried adding some tasks and changing caps on all , all tasks were added without any problem. Tried to check whether all tasks can be indicated as done instead of selecting the tasks on by one opted for complete but unfortunately it did not, refreshed to see whether it will indicate all complete , it did not.      
- What I found  difficult during the task is the knowing how to show and indicate all tasks completed.  
- On a scale of 0-10 I am at 9 in identifying and reporting bugs confidently.
